Assignment:

Create a books collection in your DB ( using bookModel with following fields)- bookName( mandatory field), price containing Indian and european price, year ( should be 2021 if no year is provided) , tags array, authorName, totalPages , stockAvailable ( true false) 

create the following API’s (write logic in bookController and routes in routes):


	
createBook : to create a new entry..use this api to create 11+ entries in your collection
	
bookList : gives all the books- their bookName and authorName only 
	
getBooksInYear: takes year as input in post request and gives list of all books published that year
	
getParticularBooks:- (this is a good one, make sincere effort to solve this) take any input and use it as a condition to fetch books that satisfy that condition
	

		
e.g if body had { name: “hi”} then you would fetch the books with this name
		
if body had { year: 2020} then you would fetch the books with this name
		
hence the condition will differ based on what you input in the request body
	
	
	
getXINRBooks- request to return all books who have an Indian price tag of “100INR” or “200INR” or “500INR” 
	
getRandomBooks - returns books that are available in stock or have more than 500 pages
